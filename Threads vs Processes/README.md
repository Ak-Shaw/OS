# Introduction

What do a t-shirt and a computer program have in common?  They are both  composed of many threads!  While the threads in a t-shirt hold the shirt together, the threads of a computer program allow the program to  execute sequential actions or many actions at once.  Each thread in a  program identifies a process that runs when the program asks it to  (unlike when you ask your roommate to do the dishes).

Processes are typically independent of each other, While threads exist as the subset of a process. Threads can communicate with each other more easily than processes can, But threads are more vulnerable to problems caused by other threads in the same process.
