# Introduction

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **concurrency** is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or  problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without  affecting the final outcome.  This allows for parallel execution of the  concurrent units, which can significantly improve overall speed of the  execution in multi-processor and multi-core systems. In more technical  terms, concurrency refers to the decomposability property of a program,  algorithm, or problem into order-independent or partially-ordered  components or units.
